    "\n",
    "### Description\n",
    "\n",
    "[Game of Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life) (GoF) is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. The game is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves, or, for advanced players, by creating patterns with particular properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two possible states, live or dead. Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are directly horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions occur:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by needs caused by underpopulation.\n",
    "* Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding.\n",
    "* Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives, unchanged, to the next generation.\n",
    "* Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "The initial pattern constitutes the 'seed' of the system. The first generation is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the seed – births and deaths happen simultaneously, and the discrete moment at which this happens is sometimes called a tick. (In other words, each generation is a pure function of the one before.) The rules continue to be applied repeatedly to create further generations."

    "This module contains the core functions needed to generate the initial distribution of the cells, i.e. the initial pattern, and their future evolution controlled by the _Game of life_ rules. \\\n",

    "\n",
    "The module _evolution_ consists in two functions, namely _newgen_ and _evolution_. They both deal with 2D numpy arrays, which contains boolean variables: `True` stands for alive cells and `False` stands for dead cells. These numpy arrays represent the 2D grid of the _Game of life_ world in which cells live. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Function _newgen_\n",
    "\n",
    "The function _newgen_ takes in input the current generation of cells and gives in output the next one, calculated through the rules of _Game of life_. Its structure is very simple. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "First, the matrix representing the current generation of cells gets padded in order to identify the borders of the corresponding grid, making a toroidal structure of the world in which they live. Then, since alive and dead cells have to respect different rules, the function creates two different arrays for their indeces: `alive_idx` and `dead_idx`. However, these arrays are traslated with respect to the original grid due to the padding procedure; hence, the function fix this by adding a traslation by [1, 1]. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, there is the actual next generation creation. The old generation matrix gets copied into a new one, which is then modified by the two for cicles that apply the _Game of life_ rules to each cell. The first for cicle make alive cells evolve, whereas the second make the dead cells evolve. "

    "* **Stabilization**: The stable **Block patterns** at the edges act as \"eaters\" or reflectors, cleaning up debris and bouncing the shuttles back to reset the cycle.\n",
    "* **Turing-Completeness**:By emitting a continuous stream of Gliders, this pattern proves the Game of Life is Turing-complete. Gliders act as data bits (1s and 0s) while their collisions simulate logical gates (AND, OR, NOT), theoretically allowing the system to perform any universal computation. As the gun cycles indefinitely, the grid's population grows linearly, providing the infinite \"memory\" and signal flow required for a universal computer.\n",
