They both deal with 2D numpy arrays, which contains boolean variables: `True` stands for alive cells and `False` stands for dead cells. These numpy arrays represent the 2D grid of the _Game of life_ world in which cells live. \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "First, the matrix representing the current generation of cells gets padded in order to identify the borders of the corresponding grid, making a toroidal structure of the world in which they live. Then, since alive and dead cells have to respect different rules, the function creates two different arrays for their indeces: `alive_idx` and `dead_idx`. However, these arrays are traslated with respect to the original grid due to the padding procedure; hence, the function fix this by adding a traslation by [1, 1]. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, there is the actual next generation creation. The old generation matrix gets copied into a new one, which is then modified by the two for cicles that apply the _Game of life_ rules to each cell. The first for cicle make alive cells evolve, whereas the second make the dead cells evolve. "
