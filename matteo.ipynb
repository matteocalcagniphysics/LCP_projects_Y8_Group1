    "The module _evolution_ consists in two functions, namely _newgen_ and _evolution_. They both deal with 2D numpy arrays, which contains boolean variables: `True` stands for alive cells and `False` stands for dead cells. These numpy arrays represent the 2D grid of the _Game of life_ world in which cells live. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Function _newgen_\n",
    "\n",
    "The function _newgen_ takes in input the current generation of cells and gives in output the next one, calculated through the rules of _Game of life_. Its structure is very simple. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "First, the matrix representing the current generation of cells gets padded in order to identify the borders of the corresponding grid, making a toroidal structure of the world in which they live. Then, since alive and dead cells have to respect different rules, the function creates two different arrays for their indeces: `alive_idx` and `dead_idx`. However, these arrays are traslated with respect to the original grid due to the padding procedure; hence, the function fix this by adding a traslation by [1, 1]. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, there is the actual next generation creation. The old generation matrix gets copied into a new one, which is then modified by the two for cicles that apply the _Game of life_ rules to each cell. The first for cicle make alive cells evolve, whereas the second make the dead cells evolve. "
