    "First, the matrix representing the current generation of cells gets padded in order to identify the borders of the corresponding grid, making a toroidal structure of the world in which they live. Then, since alive and dead cells have to respect different rules, the function creates two different arrays for their indeces: `alive_idx` and `dead_idx`. However, these arrays are traslated with respect to the original grid due to the padding procedure; hence, the function fix this by adding a traslation by [1, 1]. \n",

    "Ultimately, there is the actual next generation creation. The old generation matrix gets copied into a new one, which is then modified by the two for cicles that apply the _Game of life_ rules to each cell. The first for cicle make alive cells evolve, whereas the second make the dead cells evolve. "

    "* **Turing-Completeness**:By emitting a continuous stream of Gliders, this pattern proves the Game of Life is Turing-complete. Gliders act as data bits (1s and 0s) while their collisions simulate logical gates (AND, OR, NOT), theoretically allowing the system to perform any universal computation. As the gun cycles indefinitely, the grid's population grows linearly, providing the infinite \"memory\" and signal flow required for a universal computer.\n",
